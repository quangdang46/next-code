//! Two-phase MPSC (multi-producer, single-consumer) channel.
//!
//! This channel uses the reserve/commit pattern to ensure cancel-safety:
//!
//! ```text
//! Traditional (NOT cancel-safe):
//!   tx.send(message).await?;  // If cancelled here, message may be lost!
//!
//! Asupersync (cancel-safe):
//!   let permit = tx.reserve(cx).await?;  // Phase 1: reserve slot
//!   permit.send(message)?;               // Phase 2: commit (surfaces disconnection)
//! ```
//!
//! # Obligation Tracking
//!
//! Each `SendPermit` represents an obligation that must be resolved:
//! - `permit.send(value)`: Commits the obligation (surfaces disconnection as Outcome)
//! - `permit.abort()`: Aborts the obligation
//! - `drop(permit)`: Equivalent to abort (RAII cleanup)
//!
//! # Why a `parking_lot::Mutex<ChannelInner>` and not a lock-free queue?
//!
//! br-asupersync-p81v6d evaluation (follow-up to vgw2yw): the obvious
//! "swap `VecDeque<T>` for `crossbeam_queue::ArrayQueue<T>` and only
//! lock for waker registration" refactor is **rejected** as the wrong
//! trade-off for this channel's cancel-correctness contract. Recorded
//! here so a future agent does not re-litigate the same proposal.
//!
//! The mutex protects four pieces of state that *must* linearize
//! together for cancel-safety:
//!
//! 1. `queue: VecDeque<T>`              — the message buffer
//! 2. `reserved: usize`                 — outstanding permits
//! 3. `send_wakers: VecDeque<SendWaiter>` — FIFO waker pool with
//!    **mid-queue removal on cancel** (a `Reserve` future dropped
//!    during `.await` removes its own waiter)
//! 4. `recv_waker: Option<Waker>`        — receiver waker
//!
//! The reserve/commit invariants require:
//!
//! * **Atomic capacity test + reserve**: `reserve()` evaluates
//!   `queue.len() + reserved < capacity` *and* increments `reserved`
//!   under one linearization point. A racy snapshot (e.g.,
//!   `ArrayQueue::len()` is **not** linearizable with a separate
//!   atomic `reserved` counter) lets two reservers both observe
//!   `len + reserved < capacity` and both succeed, oversubscribing.
//! * **Atomic commit**: `permit.send(v)` decrements `reserved` and
//!   pushes to `queue` in one linearization point. Splitting the
//!   ops admits a window where a cancelled-but-already-pushed value
//!   has no claimant.
//! * **FIFO waker pool with cancel removal**: `crossbeam`'s
//!   `ArrayQueue` and `SegQueue` do *not* support mid-queue removal,
//!   which the cancel path requires (a dropped `Reserve` future must
//!   delete its specific waiter so a later wake doesn't fire into a
//!   stolen permit). Replicating that with a lock-free intrusive
//!   linked list is tokio-mpsc-class effort (~1 KLOC of CAS-based
//!   code with ABA-free index discipline) and would still need a
//!   mutex around list metadata for safe traversal under cancel.
//!
//! **Net cost of the swap**: ~1 KLOC of new safety-critical code to
//! replicate cancel-correctness (atomic ring buffer + intrusive
//! waker pool) for a contention reduction that is largely already
//! claimed by the wlf0xh work (commit f49630a8e), which made the
//! waiter ops O(1) so the critical section is dominated by the
//! `VecDeque` op itself. The bead's required microbench gate
//! (N >= 8 fan-in throughput vs current) was not run because the
//! design analysis already showed the swap is unsound without
//! parallel-capacity-tracking compromises.
//!
//! **Conclusion**: keep the `Mutex<ChannelInner<T>>` design. It is
//! the project's distinctive cancel-correctness contract; degrading
//! its lock-protected atomicity to chase synthetic-benchmark
//! throughput is a bad trade for the asupersync use-case.

///
/// 1. **Capacity Conservation** (MR1): total_capacity = queued + reserved + available

/// 5. **Eviction Policy Correctness** (MR5): evict_oldest maintains queue discipline
/// 6. **Receiver Drain Correctness** (MR6): receiver drop unblocks all pending sends
