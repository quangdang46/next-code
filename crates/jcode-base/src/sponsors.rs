//! Sponsored discovery: shared constants and provenance tracking.
//!
//! Sponsored discovery makes third-party developer tools discoverable to the
//! agent through the `discover_tools` tool, backed by a hosted manifest. All
//! agent-facing guidance lives in that tool's schema rather than the system
//! prompt.
//! Sponsors buy placement (discoverability), never recommendations. The
//! policy is disclosed in the UI with a `(sponsored discovery)` tag whose
//! definition lives at <https://jcode.sh/sponsored-discovery>.
//!
//! Design constraints (see the sponsored-discovery page for the public
//! version of this policy):
//! - Solo Systems vets every listing and enforces one-tool-call setup at the
//!   sponsor-platform admission layer for seamless harness integration.
//! - Discovery is on by default and can be opted out of with
//!   `[sponsors] enabled = false` in config.toml.
//! - The category list below is a shipped constant, so building the tool schema
//!   never requires a network request.
//! - Tools within a category live server-side and are fetched on demand by
//!   `discover_tools`. If the request fails, the tool fails plainly. There is
//!   no cache and no offline fallback.
//! - Requests carry only discovery fields (category, query, tool, and reason),
//!   never session content.
