//! Serializable data types modeling JBench's eval inputs and outputs.
//!
//! These types are direct Rust analogues of BuffBench's TypeScript types
//! (`/tmp/codebuff/evals/buffbench/types.ts`) with one deliberate
//! deviation: every field uses `snake_case` in both the Rust definition
//! and the on-disk JSON form, because the rest of next-code's serialized
//! formats already follow `snake_case`.
//!
//! All public types derive `Debug`, `Clone`, `Serialize`, and
//! `Deserialize`. Numeric scores are `f64` in the `[0.0, 10.0]` range —
//! validation is not enforced at the type level so partial / in-progress
//! results round-trip cleanly.
