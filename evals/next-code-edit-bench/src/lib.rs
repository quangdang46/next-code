//! # JCode Edit Benchmark
//!
//! Mutation-based edit benchmark harness for measuring edit-tool quality
//! across different models. Generates benchmark tasks by applying AST-level
//! mutations to real Rust source files using tree-sitter, runs agents against
//! each task, and verifies results via rustfmt-normalized comparison.
//!
//! Architecture (based on oh-my-pi's typescript-edit-benchmark):
//!
//! ```text
//! Source Files → tree-sitter parse → find candidates → apply mutation
//!   → validate single-hunk change → score difficulty
//!   → package fixtures (input/expected/prompt/metadata)
//!   → run next-code agent (parallel, best-of-N)
//!   → verify with rustfmt normalization → report
//! ```
